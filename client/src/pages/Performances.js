                <p><strong>Costume fee: </strong></p>   
                <ul>
                        <li>$30-$55 fee per child for costumes (per class)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 child = $30</li>
                    <li>2 children = $50</li>
                    <li>3+ children = $60 (only 1 fee, even if they're in all 3 recitals)</li>

                <p>If your child is in more than one class you may choose which ones to participate in for recital. All fees 
                    must be paid in full by March 19th.  If you are participating, you may pay by check or charge to your 
                    debit/credit card. We need the recital/costume fees paid early since this helps the teachers to begin 
                    ordering costumes. There are no other mandatory fees (like ticket sales, professional photographs, etc)
                     associated with recital.</p>

            <br/><br/><p id="performances-bottomNote"><i><u>Note:</u> We are charged a very high fee to lease out a school for the full day of the recitals and there 
            are other significant costs associated with putting on a recital at a school. This is the reason for the recital
             fee. By paying this fee, you are free to invite anybody you would like to watch your dancers perform (per current
              Covid rules) since there are not tickets required for admission.</i></p>
