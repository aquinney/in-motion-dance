                        <li>No food, gum or drink in the studios (with the exception of  water).</li>
                        <li>Attendance is very important to ensure each student’s progress. Students who miss 3 consecutive classes without prior arrangement may be dismissed from upcoming performances.</li>
                        <li>To avoid injury, students should arrive on time for a proper warm-up.  If a student is more than 10 min late, they may be asked to observe.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>After class is over, we would appreciate it if your child is left no longer than 5 minutes to be picked
                             up.  If you are running late, please call the studio cell number so that we can make arrangements.  
                             Please instruct your child to wait inside of the studio. We do not have office staff available to 
                             watch your child. If you are late, you assume full responsibility for your child’s welfare.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><strong>Assumption of Responsibilities and Risks</strong></p>

                        <li>Please be aware that dance, like any physical activity, comes with the risk of potential injury. 
                            Registration at In Motion Dance Studio includes understanding and accepting the risk and assuming
                             responsibility for the safety of your child. We will take every step possible to provide a safe 
                             and healthy learning environment for you and your dancer.</li>

            <h2>Adding / Transferring Classes</h2>
                <p>If a student wishes, they may transfer to a different class as long as there are openings in the class.
                     After notifying office personnel, and if the class is the same price, no other action is needed. To 
                     add additional classes, a student must notify office personnel, so that the class can be added to 
                     tuition. If adding in the middle of a month, a student will pay a prorated class rate until the new
                      month begins.</p>

            <div className="policy-cancelation">
            <h2>Canceling Classes</h2>
                <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> notify us in writing (email, phone or text) by 2 weeks prior to the 1st of the next month. For 
                    example: cancelling for February requires notification by January 18th, etc.  If we receive notice after
                     that date but before the 1st of the next month, you will be charged a $5 cancellation fee.  Cancelling 
                     between the 1st and the 15th of the month, you will receive half tuition refund.  Cancelling anytime after
                      the 15th, you will not receive a tuition refund for the current month.  Please notify us if you don’t 
                      receive a cancellation confirmation email/text back from us.<br/><br/>If cancelling for one month (exceptions are made for illness and injury), you may lose your spot in the class and will need to re-enroll in the studio. This includes having to pay another registration fee.</p>

            <div className="policy-makeup">
            <h2>Make-Up Classes</h2>
                <p>If a student misses a class or we are closed for a holiday, students are invited to attend any class 
                    that is their same level during the week. Classes must be “made up” within 30 days of the missed class.
                     They do not carry over. We also allow for anticipatory make-ups, meaning if students know that they 
                     will be out-of-town for a certain week, they can make-up the class before they leave. Make sure to 
                     inform the teacher that the student is doing a make-up class.</p>
